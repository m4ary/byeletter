[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- API access with `API_KEY` (`Authorization: Bearer`). Add a mailbox with just an email and app password, choose the first scan, and list provider presets at `GET /api/providers`. See `docs/API.md`.
- MIT license, contributing guide, security policy and a README screenshot.

### Changed
- A failed mailbox login when adding a mailbox returns `422` instead of `401`.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-29

### Removed
- The Outlook OAuth proxy service and its "Outlook / Microsoft 365 (OAuth proxy)" provider. Outlook still works with an app password where Microsoft allows it.

### Changed
- Multi-arch images are built on native amd64 and arm64 runners (the emulated arm64 build could hang).
- Release notes come from this changelog.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added
- Optional `outlook-proxy` Compose service (Email OAuth 2.0 Proxy) and an "Outlook / Microsoft 365 (OAuth proxy)" provider, so Outlook works without an app password.

### Changed
- Releases are automatic: bumping the version in `package.json` on `main` publishes the image, tag and GitHub release.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added
- Multiple mailboxes, saved in a SQLite database with AES-256-GCM encrypted credentials.
- Dashboard with totals and a newsletter list across all mailboxes, filterable by mailbox and status.
- Scan every mailbox together, or one at a time; IMAP mailboxes can scan all folders.
- Background scans with live progress; duplicates across folders are counted once by Message-ID.
- Unsubscribe history is stored on the server, with "mark done" and undo.

### Changed
- The single-mailbox login is replaced by the Mailboxes page; the Docker image now uses a `/app/data` volume.

## [0.1.0]

### Added
- Mailbox sign-in over IMAP and POP3, with presets for Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, iCloud, AOL, Zoho, Yandex, GMX, Mail.com, Fastmail and Proton Mail Bridge.
- Newsletter detection from `List-Unsubscribe` headers, grouped by sender.
- Unsubscribe by RFC 8058 one-click, a `mailto:` sent over SMTP, or a manual link; bulk unsubscribe.
- App-wide login page protected by `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
- Docker image, docker-compose, and a GitHub Actions workflow that publishes to GHCR.
