## Features

- **All your mailboxes in one place.** Add as many IMAP or POP3 accounts as you like. Presets cover Gmail, Outlook/Hotmail, Yahoo, iCloud, AOL, Zoho, Yandex, GMX, Mail.com, Fastmail and Proton Mail Bridge, and any other server works with custom settings.
- **One dashboard.** See totals and a single newsletter list across every mailbox. Filter it by mailbox, status or search text.
- **Scan everything, or one mailbox deeply.** Scan all mailboxes together or one at a time, the inbox or every folder, reading the newest 100–5,000 messages per folder. Scans run in the background with live progress.
- **Smart detection.** Any message with a `List-Unsubscribe` header counts as a newsletter. Messages are grouped by sender, and a message found in several folders (Gmail labels, for example) is counted once. Only headers are downloaded, so scans are fast.
- **One-click unsubscribe.** Byeletter tries the most automatic method first:
  1. **One-click** ([RFC 8058](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8058)): a request to the sender's unsubscribe endpoint.
  2. **Email**: an unsubscribe email sent from your own account.
  3. **Manual**: a link to finish on the sender's site, then **Mark done**.
- **Bulk actions and history.** Select many senders and unsubscribe from them together. Results are saved, so you can come back later or undo.
- **Private by design.** A password protects the whole app. Mailbox passwords are stored encrypted, and there's no telemetry and no third-party service.

## Quick start

You need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) with Compose.

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m4ary/byeletter/main/docker-compose.yml
curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m4ary/byeletter/main/.env.example
# edit .env: set ADMIN_PASSWORD, and SESSION_SECRET (openssl rand -hex 32)
docker compose up -d
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

1. **Unlock** the app with your `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
2. **Add a mailbox:** enter your email address and the provider is picked for you. Most providers need an [app password](#app-passwords). Byeletter checks the login, saves it encrypted and scans your inbox straight away.
3. **Scan:** use **Scan all mailboxes** on the dashboard, or scan one mailbox from the **Mailboxes** page. Choose **All folders** to include folders like Promotions or Spam.
4. **Unsubscribe:** click **Unsubscribe** on a sender, or select several and use **Unsubscribe selected**.

## App passwords

Most big providers don't accept your normal password for IMAP or POP. Create an **app password** and use it instead. The add-mailbox form links to instructions where the provider has them.

| Provider | How |
| --- | --- |
| Gmail | Turn on 2-Step Verification, create an [App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords), and enable IMAP in Gmail settings |
| Yahoo / AOL | Account Security → Generate app password |
| iCloud | IMAP only. Create an app-specific password at [appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com) |
| Outlook / Microsoft 365 | Microsoft is removing password logins, so this only works where your account still allows them |
| Proton Mail | Run [Proton Mail Bridge](https://proton.me/mail/bridge) and use the password it generates (see [Docker notes](#docker-notes)) |

Email unsubscribes are sent through your provider's SMTP server. For custom servers you can add SMTP settings; without them, Byeletter opens the unsubscribe email in your own mail app instead.

## Configuration

Set these in `.env` (Compose) or as container environment variables.

| Variable | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | yes | Password for the app's login page. If it's not set, nobody can unlock the app |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | recommended | 32+ random characters (`openssl rand -hex 32`). Encrypts the login cookie **and the saved mailbox passwords**. If unset, a key is derived from `ADMIN_PASSWORD`. Keep it stable: if it changes, saved mailboxes must be added again |
| `COOKIE_SECURE` | no | `true` makes the login cookie HTTPS-only. Compose sets `false` so plain `http://` works on your network; set `true` behind HTTPS |
| `API_KEY` | no | Enables the [API](#api) for scripts and other tools. At least 32 random characters (`openssl rand -hex 32`) |
| `PORT` | no | Host port in Compose (default `3000`) |
| `BYELETTER_VERSION` | no | Image version in Compose (default `latest`) |
| `DATA_DIR` | no | Where the SQLite database is stored. Defaults to `./data`; the Docker image uses `/app/data` |

## API

Set `API_KEY` and you can add mailboxes, start scans and unsubscribe from scripts or other tools:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/accounts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "me@gmail.com", "password": "your-app-password", "label": "Personal"}'
```

For known providers the email address and app password are enough. See [docs/API.md](docs/API.md) for custom servers and every endpoint.

## Updating and backups

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

To stay on a specific release, set `BYELETTER_VERSION` in `.env`: an exact version like `1.2.0`, `1.2` for its latest patch, or `1` for the latest 1.x. The [releases page](https://github.com/m4ary/byeletter/releases) and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) list what changed.

Your mailboxes and scan results live in the `byeletter-data` volume (`/app/data` in the container). Back it up together with your `SESSION_SECRET`, since you need both to read the saved mailboxes.

## Docker notes

- Images are published at `ghcr.io/m4ary/byeletter` for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. They run as a non-root user.
- **Without Compose:**
  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v byeletter-data:/app/data \
    -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=change-me -e SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) -e COOKIE_SECURE=false \
    ghcr.io/m4ary/byeletter:latest
  ```
- **Build from source** instead of pulling: `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.build.yml up -d --build`
- **Proton Mail Bridge on the same machine:** inside a container, `127.0.0.1` is the container itself. Pick the **Other** provider and use `host.docker.internal` as the server; Compose already maps it to your host.
- **Behind a reverse proxy with HTTPS:** set `COOKIE_SECURE=true`.

## Privacy and security

- **Your data stays with you.** Byeletter only talks to your mail servers and, when you unsubscribe, to the sender's unsubscribe link or address. There's no telemetry, account or cloud service.
- **Mailbox passwords** are checked with a real login, then stored in the local database encrypted with AES-256-GCM. They're never sent back to the browser.
- **The whole app** is behind `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (and the API behind `API_KEY`, if you set one), with an encrypted, `httpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict` session cookie that expires after 8 hours. Wrong guesses are limited to 10 per IP every 15 minutes.
- **Unsubscribe links come from untrusted emails**, so one-click requests refuse private and local network addresses and don't follow redirects. Links are always read from the saved scan, never from the browser.
- Once unlocked, the app can connect to any mail server you enter. Use a strong `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, and put the app behind HTTPS if you expose it to the internet.
